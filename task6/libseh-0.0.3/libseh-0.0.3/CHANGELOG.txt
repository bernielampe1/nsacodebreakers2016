
Changes:

v0.0.3:
	* Apparently, the previous change to the positioning of __label__
      declarations broke compatibility with GCC 3.x.  

v0.0.2:
	* Apparently GCC 4.x treats __label__ statements differently, which would not allow the test
	  programs to compile.  This has been fixed.

v0.0.1:
	* Initial public release.
